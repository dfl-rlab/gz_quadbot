# Gazebo_go2_for_3d_navigation

## Overview
This repository provides a simplified simulation of the Unitree Go2 quadruped robot in a Gazebo world.  
It could integrate with the [dddmr_navigation](https://github.com/dfl-rlab/dddmr_navigation) stack and has already been tested for 3D mapping and navigation capabilities.






## Acknowledgements

This project is based on and extends the excellent work from [Unitree-go2-ros2](https://github.com/anujjain-dev/unitree-go2-ros2).  
We are grateful to the original author for the ROS2 integration of the Unitree Go2 robot in Gazebo.  
The original authors did the core work — we just build on top of it.

As acknowledged in that project, credits also go to the following upstream works:
* [Unitree Robotics](https://github.com/unitreerobotics/unitree_ros) – For the Go2 robot description (URDF model).  
* [CHAMP](https://github.com/chvmp/champ) – For the quadruped controller framework.
