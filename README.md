# Gazebo Go2 Quadbot for 3D Autonomous Navigation

## Overview
This repository provides a lightweight and ready-to-use simulation of the Unitree Go2 quadruped robot in a Gazebo world.  
Paired with the [dddmr_navigation](https://github.com/dfl-rlab/dddmr_navigation) stack,  you can quickly try out **3D mapping and autonomous navigation** without setting up everything from scratch.  Itâ€™s here to give you an easy starting point for getting into 3D navigation.

## How to use
To unlock the full 3D navigation experience, youâ€™ll need to integrate this simulation with the `dddmr_navigation` stack.  

ðŸ‘‰ Start by following the step-by-step guide here:  [**dddmr_beginner_guide**](https://github.com/dfl-rlab/dddmr_navigation/tree/main/src/dddmr_beginner_guide)  

The guide will walk you through everything you need â€” from setup to your first navigation test.  
By the end, youâ€™ll have Gazebo and 3D navigation up and running, ready to explore and learn.
